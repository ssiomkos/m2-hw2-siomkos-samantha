    <h1>Samantha Siomkos</h1>
    <h3><u>About</u></h3>
    <p>My name is Samantha but everyone calls me Sam. I am originally from West Palm Beach, Florida but 
        relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina when I was ten. I moved to Raleigh for college and never left.
        I am the youngest of five siblings and have a really close family. I love being an aunt; I have three nieces (Katie, Joey, and Maggie) 
        and one nephew (Griffin). During the pandemic my husband and I rescued a dog named Ranger and it was the best
        decision ever. See a picture of Ranger visiting Home Depot below!

    <h3><u>Career Goals</u></h3>
    <p>If I were to remain working in a corportate setting I would like to change industries and leave the 
        financial services industry. I currently work in compliance IT for the bank and I would just like to find 
        a product I am more connected to. Otherwise I would like to go into business for myself as perhaps a freelance
        web designer/developer.
